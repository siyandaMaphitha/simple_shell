Everything you need to know to start coding your own shell
PID & PPID

Exercise 0
0. getppid.c
Write a program that prints the PID of the parent process. Run your program several times within the same shell. It should be the same. Does echo $$ print the same value? Why?

0.1 /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
Write a shell script that prints the maximum value a process ID can be.

Exercise 1
1.0 av.c
Write a program that prints all the arguments, without using ac.

1.1. Read _line.c 
Write a program that prints "$ ", wait for the user to enter a command, prints it on the next line.

(man 3 getline)

important make sure you read the man, and the RETURN VALUE section, in order to know when to stop reading Keyword: “end-of-file”, or EOF (or Ctrl+D).

#advanced: Write your own version of getline.

1.2. command_line_to_av.c
Write a function that splits a string and returns an array of each word of the string.

(man strtok)

#advanced: Write the function without strtok

Exercise 2
2.0 execve.c
The system call execve allows a process to execute another program (man 2 execve). Note that this system call does load the new program into the current process’ memory in place of the “previous” program: on success execve does not return to continue the rest of the “previous” program.

Warning: in this example, execve is used without the current environment (last argument), don’t forget to add it in your Shell!

Exercise 3 
3.0 FORK.c
The system call execve allows a process to execute another program (man 2 execve). Note that this system call does load the new program into the current process’ memory in place of the “previous” program: on success execve does not return to continue the rest of the “previous” program.

Warning: in this example, execve is used without the current environment (last argument), don’t forget to add it in your Shell!

3.1 Using the return value of fork, it is possible to know if the current process is the father or the child: fork will return 0 to the child, and the PID of the child to the father.

Exercise 4 
4.1 WAIT.c
The wait system call (man 2 wait) suspends execution of the calling process until one of its children terminates.

Exercise 5
fork+wait+execve.c
Write a program that executes the command ls -l /tmp in 5 different child processes. Each child should be created by the same process (the father). Wait for a child to exit before creating a new child.

Exercise 6
super_simple_shell.c
Using everything we saw, write a first version of a super simple shell that can run commands with their full path, without any argument.

Exercise 7 


Exercise 7 
0. printenv with environ
Write a program that prints the environment using the global variable environ.

1. env vs environ
Write a program that prints the address of env (the third parameter of the main function) and environ (the global variable). Are they they same? Does this make sense?

Prototype: char *_getenv(const char *name);

Write a function that prints each directory contained in the the environment variable PATH, one directory per line.

4. PATH
